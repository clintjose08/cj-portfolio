            I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer with 10+ years of experience delivering high-performance, scalable web apps. 
            I specialize in building robust user interfaces using React, TypeScript, GraphQL, and modern tooling.

            I've led frontend architecture for large-scale platforms like RMS2 â€” an AI-powered seat-level pricing system 
            that optimized over 100,000 seats and helped grow revenue by 5%. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, 
            mentoring engineers, and shipping production-grade features that make a business impact.
